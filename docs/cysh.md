# Caseload Changes on CYSH

Caseload changes via cyschoolhouse will be managed by program managers after Impact Analytics goes through the initial enrollment process. Program managers will then validate and mange any changes needed thereafter. Program managers may create their own process of identifying, validating, and managing changes or may use their focus list workbooks.

### Managing Caseloads Using the Focus List WkBk:

- Sections/columns X-X were created to help with caseload management
- ACMS can use column X to identify students that need to be added or removed from a caseload
- PMs can use column X to keep track of their actions
- Columns X are there to assist

### Validating and Managing Focus List Caseloads

> - New students must meet the focus list criteria:
>   -  Students in 3rd grade – 9th grades
>   - Students that are at risk for falling behind
>   - ***Students that are not on another ACM’s focus list***
> - Removing students from a focus list must have a valid reason:
>   - Student moved classes
>   - Chronic absenteeism
>   - Student left the school
