# Getting Student Data
### Data Access (Teacher schedules for In Class Deployment)

Data is key to much of what the Analytics team does each year but as a contractor for the district we can only get a limited scope of data and it must be stored securely. For both of our school districts the process of getting student data is different. See your school district below for more specifics on how to get school specific data for ACM deployment, focus lists and ELT.


## Los Angeles Unified School District

In June CYLA should communicate to LAUSD Office of Data and Accountability about re-establishing a data use contract for the coming school year. This process has been historically slow and should be started as soon as possible. 

To assist in this process, we need directors and managers to provide the Analytics team with a list of the intended teacher classes that ACMs will be providing services. This should be done via the draft deployment tool discussed below. Analytics may also need school partners to run teacher schedule reports for LA Unified schools so that we get the teacher names and course names to officially send to LAUSD data team so that we can request student records. More details will be provided below if thatâ€™s the case.


## Inglewood Unified School District


Inglewood uses a data platform called Schoolzilla to manage their data. City Year uses Schoolzilla to access student performance data for your schools. Sometime in the first quarter the Analytics team will provide a training specifically for IUSD schools on how to access Schoolzilla for viewing student performance data.
