# Extended Learning Time

With a new data use agreement from both of our school districts in FY21 our after school data management processes need to undergo some changes. Additionally corps members have expressed how complicated tracking time in ELT has been so in FY22 the Analytics team is hoping to make some simplifications and improvements to ELT attendance tracking while **also adding some important steps** to comply with our new data agreements.

## ELT Proccess
### Applications
As part of our data agreement with LAUSD all students will need to have an ELT application on file BEFORE attending after school programming in FY22. If a student attends ELT without an application City Year runs the risk of being sued if anything happens to the child while they are in the care of City Year (This has happened in the past). To ensure that we are protecting ourselves legally AND that we are keeping students safe by having emergency contact information on hand for our students we will need all students to have an ELT application and to have that application digitized into the ELT workbooks on Cyconnect.
To learn more about the applications processes see [this video.]()

### ELT Workbooks

Part of the role of a team leader will be to ensure all ELT applications, student enrollment and time in and out is recorded daily on the Analytics provided Extended Learning Time Workbooks. The two main purposes of these ELT workbooks are to verify student ELT applications and to provide a space for tracking program attendance so that we can determine if our program is meeting our desired outcomes.
ELT workbooks should be available to team leaders in early August and specific trainings for team leaders will be upcoming. Come back for links to said trainings and resources later.

### ELT Roles

Below is a table that helps to clarify the roles of everyone in after school data management. While the program manager is ultimately the person who supervises all school based activities we view the Team Leader as the owner of most day to day extended learning time activities, logistics and execution. This is particularly true when it involves the data that is being managed for ELT.
Team leaders will be the people that Impact Analytics reaches out to when ELT applications need to be entered into the system, when student IDs need correcting, when time entry needs to happen more regularly and more. We hope to have regular check ins with team leaders to support them in all of these tasks moving forward.
